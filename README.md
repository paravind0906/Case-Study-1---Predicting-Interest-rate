# Case-Study-1-Predicting-Interest-rate

The Data set represents thousands of loans made through the Lending Club platform, which is a platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals.
In this project, we will follow the below workflow.
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis, Identify NA values and clean the data 
2. Data Visualizations
3. Feature Engineering and Selection
4. Build a regression model to predict the interest rate assigned to each loan.
5. Validation on test data

Models Built:
Linear Regression
XGBoost
RandomforestRegressor

Model validation: 
RMSE
